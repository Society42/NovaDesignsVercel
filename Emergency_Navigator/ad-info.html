      <h2>Our Advertising Banners</h2>
      <p>
        Our advertising banners showcase all our partners. You can see them
        around the site, but we aim to keep them unobtrusive and easy to close.
        Click on the "Learn More" button in an ad banner to be taken directly to
        the partner's server. If no specific ad is available, you will be
        directed to this page for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ads will be showcased in the advertisement banners and on our
        collaboration page. To learn more about our advertising partners, join
