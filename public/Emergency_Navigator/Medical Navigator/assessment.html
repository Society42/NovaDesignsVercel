            <h2>Primary Survey</h2></br>
            <p>
            <strong>Danger:</strong> Check for any surrounding danger around the casualty, if there is any danger or something that poses a risk to you or another person attempt to remove it safely.
          </p></br>

          <p>
            <strong>Response:</strong> Check to see if the casualty is responding, this can be done by shaking their shoulders and asking them to open their eyes or asking them simple questions like “What year is it.”.
          </p></br>

          <p>
            <strong>Airways:</strong> Ensure that the casualty’s airways are clear if they are unconscious, this may involve tilting their head back using 2 fingers and tilting their chin back and one hand on the forehead doing the same tilting back motion. If they are conscious then you may ask them to sit up, if they are unable to do so continue with DRABC.
          </p></br>

          <p>
            <strong>Breathing:</strong>  Once the casualty's airways are clear check to see if they are breathing clearly. This can be done by putting your ear to their mouth and listening for breathing for up to 10 seconds and watching for a rising and falling movement of their chest. Note there is a sign of cardiac arrest known as “agonal gasping” which is when They can open their mouths, extend their neck, and take usually slow, sometimes noisy gasps.
          </p></br>

          <p>
            <strong>Circulation:</strong> When you have completed all other previous steps you must then check for any severe bleeding. If they have severe bleeding you must treat such accordingly if they are conscious or unconscious.
