                <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is committed to maintaining a professional, respectful, and inclusive environment for all personnel and collaborators. This Behavior Policy outlines the expectations for staff conduct and the disciplinary actions that may result from violations.</br></br>

                <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
        
                <h3>A. Professionalism and Respect</h3>
                <p>FBI personnel must treat colleagues, community members, and partners with respect, courtesy, and professionalism at all times. Discriminatory, harassing, or offensive behavior based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or any other protected characteristic is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.</p>
        
                <h3>B. Integrity and Honesty</h3>

                <h3>C. Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>FBI personnel must protect the privacy and confidentiality of classified information, operational details, and sensitive data.

                <h3>D. Responsibility and Accountability</h3>
                <p>All personnel are accountable for their actions and decisions. They must take ownership of their duties and address any mistakes promptly. Failure to meet responsibilities or negligence in fulfilling duties will result in disciplinary measures.</p>
        
                <h3>E. Collaboration and Teamwork</h3>
                <p>Effective collaboration is essential to the success of FBI operations. Personnel are expected to communicate openly, share relevant information, and support team members. Sabotaging, undermining, or failing to cooperate with colleagues will not be tolerated.</p>
        
                <h3>F. Communication</h3>

                <h3>G. Conflict Resolution</h3>
                <p>Conflicts should be addressed promptly and constructively through open dialogue. If resolution cannot be achieved at the team level, escalation to higher management is encouraged.</p>

                <h2>Prohibited Behavior</h2>
        
                <h3>A. Harassment and Bullying</h3>
                <p>Any form of harassment, bullying, or intimidation—whether verbal, physical, or written—is strictly prohibited. This includes unwanted advances, threats, derogatory comments, or any behavior that creates a hostile environment.</p>

                <h2>Disciplinary Actions</h2>
        
                <h3>A. Types of Violations</h3>
        
                <h4>Minor Violations</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Examples:</strong> Unprofessional conduct, such as inappropriate language or minor rudeness. Failure to adhere to the dress code or tardiness. Minor procedural errors, such as misfiled reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> Verbal Warning (sometimes documented in personnel file). Mandatory retraining or coaching. Accumulation of strikes for repeated offenses.
                </p>
        
                <h4>Major Violations</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Examples:</strong> Misuse of authority or resources. Corruption or conflict of interest. Excessive force or violations of civil rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> Immediate suspension, pending investigation. Issuance of strikes or termination. Legal review and potential criminal charges.
                </p>
        
                <h4>Illegal Activities</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Examples:</strong> Theft, bribery, or embezzlement. Espionage or leaking classified information. Participation in organized crime or acts of terrorism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> Immediate termination. Referral for criminal prosecution, including federal felony charges. Imprisonment if convicted.
                </p>
        
                <h3>B. Reporting Misconduct</h3>
        
                <h4>Internal Reporting</h4>
                <p>Violations or suspected misconduct must be reported to a direct supervisor or the National Internal Affairs Office (NIAO). You have the option to stay anonymous for sensitive cases.</p>
        
                <h4>Whistleblower Protection</h4>
                <p>Employees who report misconduct in good faith are fully protected from retaliation under federal law, including the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. Retaliation against whistleblowers will result in severe disciplinary measures, including termination of the retaliating party.</p>
        
                <h3>C. Disciplinary Actions and Strike System</h3>
        
                <h4>Strike System</h4>
                <p>A formal strike system ensures consistent consequences for repeat offenders while allowing flexibility for unique circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First Strike:</strong> Written warning and/or mandatory retraining.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Strike:</strong> Suspension without pay for 3-7 days, depending on severity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third Strike:</strong> Immediate termination or escalation to criminal charges if applicable.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4>Escalation Based on Role or Severity</h4>
                <p>
                    Personnel in high-command roles or those with access to sensitive information will face stricter evaluations. A minor violation by high-command personnel may be escalated to a Major Violation due to the potential impact on the FBI’s reputation or operations.
                </p>
        
                <h4>Punishments by Violation Severity</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Minor Violations:</strong> Verbal or written warnings. Retraining or reassignment of duties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Major Violations:</strong> Suspension. Demotion or reassignment to non-sensitive roles. Termination, if warranted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Illegal Activities:</strong> Immediate dismissal. Arrest and referral for prosecution under federal law. For espionage or severe breaches, potential life imprisonment or other statutory penalties.
                </p>
        
                <h4>High Command/NIAO Authority</h4>
                <p>
                    High Command and the National Internal Affairs Office reserve the right to escalate disciplinary actions based on the circumstances. This includes bypassing the strike system when deemed necessary for the protection of FBI operations, public trust, or national security.
